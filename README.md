## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gyda, and I am a Front-end development student at Noroff. I am looking forward to learning the basics of being a developer. My goal for the future is to build a solid foundation in web technologies, enhance my coding skills, and create user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I want to become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks.
